This board could guide the academy's direction, ensuring that programs stay relevant to real-world needs and global trends. Having an external layer of insight would help maintain high standards and ensure the academy evolves with the rapidly changing AI landscape.
I also believe that a strong feedback and iteration system is essential. Learners should be encouraged to share their experiences after each course, especially around the practical value and clarity of instruction. Regularly analyzing this feedback would allow for continuous refinement of content and teaching methods.
Finally, the development of a data-driven learning platform should be a top priority. Tracking outcomes like learner progress, job placements, and startup successes would provide valuable insights into what’s working and what needs adjustment. This kind of transparency would not only improve the learner experience but also position HUMAIN Academy as a forward-thinking, results-driven institution that’s genuinely preparing talent for the future of AI.",2025-09-05T16:54:29.177Z,1757091269177,0,1,0,0,ACoAAAGwDW0BINlKSmL7oOkPYbyTKoKZ01umPh8,Shahnawaz Gaur,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahnawaz-gaur-ba55959,"Chief Technology, AI Innovation & Strategy Leader | Digital Platforms| SmartSolutions| Sr Chief Engineer/ Director Engineering & R&D @Samsung|TopVoice(Java,GenAI,AgenticAI, BigData,MultiCloud, DataScience,VR/XR,Robotics)",False,False,False,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tareq-amin_humainacademy-humainai-vision2030-activity-7369227868972691457-0KQD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACCpDGQBLE7ICN-CROeyxPPeLsCNhUqpCd0,1220,183,9,suggestion_idea,0.95,leadership_exec,0.9

20% foundational concepts
40% tool-based skill building (LangChain, Hugging Face, AutoML, Kaggle, etc.)
30% applied projects with industry mentors
10% entrepreneurial mindset (building AI-first products)

What will set HUMAIN Academy apart is not just teaching AI, but teaching how to think, build, and deploy AI in context:
	•	Real industry use cases (healthcare, energy, finance, smart cities).
	•	End-to-end skills (not just building models, but deploying, scaling & monitoring them).
	•	Interdisciplinary mindset (AI + product, design, entrepreneurship).
	•	Adaptive learning paths (personalized journeys for students, professionals, and founders).

My ideal path? Foundations → hands-on labs → deployment challenge → capstone with a real industry partner. That creates not just AI users, but true builders and innovators ready to accelerate Vision 2030.

	1.	Applied AI in industries such as finance, healthcare, and retail, with hands-on case studies.
	2.	AI ethics, compliance, and governance — critical for building trust and aligning with regulations like SAMA in Saudi Arabia.
	3.	Integration skills — helping learners understand how to move AI from proof-of-concept to scalable enterprise solutions.

In alignment with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 and HUMAIN’s mission, I would strongly recommend designing programs that prepare C-level leaders, policymakers, and executives to guide AI adoption responsibly. Beyond technical training, we need curricula that address:
AI governance and data governance as the foundation of responsible adoption.
AI ethics and security to ensure solutions are safe, trusted, and regulation-ready.
Leadership education — empowering executives to design AI roadmaps, governance models, and automation strategies.
Case studies and real-world examples drawn from multiple industries to make the learning practical and immediately relevant.

We may know the theory, but learning how to turn it into selecting the right models, using the right data, and finding the right solutions is where the real challenge lies.

That’s why I think your program should emphasize:
-   Business-driven problem solving: Framing challenges in industries like retail, healthcare, or finance, and mapping them to AI approaches.
-   Data in practice: Collecting, cleaning, and governing real datasets to prepare them for production pipelines.
-   Deployment & scale: Hands-on with GPUs/LPUs, containerization, and cloud orchestration—moving from a working notebook to a deployed service.

At Excelledia - AI CoE, we share your belief that AI learning must move beyond theory into practice.

For over a decade, we’ve partnered with major government agencies and corporations across the Middle East, helping them establish AI Academies and learning ecosystems aligned with global best practice frameworks. This experience has shown us how critical it is to move AI learning beyond theory into hands-on, real-world application.

We’ve built dedicated programmes for business leaders and organizations (Zero to AI in 90 days) that combine role-based AI awareness, skill-building, and live solution development — with many businesses creating their own AI IP along the way.

For students, our “Learn by Doing” model (40 hours of immersive learning + 60 hours of applied projects alongside business leaders) has been a breakthrough, producing graduates who are not just employable but project-ready from day one. plus many more including Chief AI Officer and Executive AI MBA.

All with exciting international certifications and accreditations.

We’d love to explore how our ecosystem can complement HUMAIN Academy and together set a new global benchmark for AI talent in Saudi and beyond.

Computing took decades to go from a top‑up skill to a core part of every discipline. AI is on the same path, only faster.

At KFUPM’s College of Computing and Mathematics, I help lead AI+X. We shifted to an AI‑first model: build AI skills early, then go deep by domain. With redesign and industry input, graduates became job‑ready.

For HUMAIN Academy: 
- Design AI‑first programs where learners build, deploy, and ship every week. 
- Make certifications assessment-based, not attendance-based. 
- Treat industry as co‑designer: real backlogs, production tools, mentors who sign off on readiness
- Build an AI‑native platform: let AI teach AI with adaptive paths, hands‑on labs, and automated feedback
- Serve students, professionals, and founders. Universities graduate thinkers; an academy can graduate doers
- Coordinate nationally with schools, universities, training agencies, and regulators
- Design for Gen Z and Gen Y: short cycles, project-based, social learning, portfolios tied to real artifacts

Focus areas: Data and MLOps; Applied GenAI; vertical AI; Responsible AI; Productization

AI for Networking
Networking for AI
My fellow technical leaders have already provided feedback on AI-N/W. As a Data Center Solution Consultant, my focus is on Networking for AI.
Currently, it is very difficult to find design-level training on N/W for AI, and I believe this is where your academy can create real value. It would be excellent if you could offer dedicated training in this area. Below is a suggested high-level structure:
AI Data Center Design Fundamentals
Per-rack power and cooling requirements for AI workloads
Overview of available GPU servers (e.g., NVIDIA GB200/GB300) and how GPUs work
How InfiniBand and RoCEv2 function (including packet walk-throughs)
Scalable Unit design concepts
Rail-optimized architectures
NCCL/RCCL, DCQCN, and related technologies
AI Data Center Design Specialist
Designing and scaling 1K+ GPU clusters
Techniques to optimize RoCEv2 performance
I believe including these modules would make the academy’s curriculum unique and highly valuable for engineers who want to specialize in this emerging field.

This is a field where AI can have real impact on human well-being. I’d be happy to contribute by sharing real-world case studies using patient data to show how AI can be applied in practice to enhance mental health outcomes.

One of the key challenges I’ve noticed is that many people are eager to build AI models, but they’re not always clear on the why and what problem they’re solving or how AI truly adds value. At the same time, there are others who can build models technically, but lack the practical know-how to test, validate, and deploy them in real-world environments. Addressing both of these gaps such as, problem-first thinking and end-to-end deployment skills. It will make a real difference in how AI is applied across industries. I also believe it’s essential to focus on Applied AI and MLOps, ensuring learners go beyond notebooks into production using tools like Docker, APIs, SageMaker, and CI/CD.

I believe the real game changer will be focusing on hands on skills directly tied to market needs. 

Training learners on real AI tools through practical projects will set HUMAIN Academy apart as a model for the region. 

Excited to see how this vision will empower Saudi talent and contribute to Vision 2030.

There are many people on the region for whom AI is a mystery because they don't have the same literacy levels thay AI training courses assumes everyone had, other learn best with certain mediums, be it text, audio, images or videos. Language is also an issue.

So I guess ensuring that potential trainees have agency to be able to choose how they get to learn is super important. With AI it's possible got mass personalisation, so we have no excuse.

From my experience across entertainment, media, and marketplaces, working with both fresh graduates and seasoned professionals, I can offer few thoughts.

- The traditional path of long academic study followed by years of hands-on work isn’t scalable for AI. It leaves many professionals unprepared for complex challenges and limits cross-industry innovation, whether in drug discovery, gaming, or personalized commerce.

- Universities and online platforms already cover AI fundamentals. What’s urgently needed is applied AI education, how to use emerging models and tools in real-world contexts to drive second-order innovation.

- This calls for modern curricula and teaching methods that produce immediately deployable skills, supported by local and international partnerships between industry and academia. Experts, students, and researchers should collaborate to build courses that address real use cases.

- Finally, we need learning tracks tailored to different levels of AI literacy. Some theory is important, but the emphasis must be on practical, applied skills that empower more people to put AI to work.",2025-09-04T17:26:10.444Z,1757006770444,0,1,0,0,ACoAAAEcavIBMnvIgk4jZA-J1MfxPnFyW5Wyngw,Sultan Mahmood,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sultan-mahmood,"Senior Technology Leader • Head of Digital Engineering @ Qiddiya & SEVEN • Ex Grubhub, Shutterstock & HBO • Enterprise & Consumer Technology • AI/ML Innovation • Architecture & Delivery • Digital Transformation",False,False,True,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tareq-amin_humainacademy-humainai-vision2030-activity-7369227868972691457-0KQD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACCpDGQBLE7ICN-CROeyxPPeLsCNhUqpCd0,1189,178,10,suggestion_idea,0.95,leadership_exec,0.9

Mashallah best of luck and it's glad to see how you are driving monumental impact!
1) AI literacy is much more than AI training: lot of effort is often required in building familiarity, comfort, for each level of cohort (how this impacts me, what this means to my job/role, etc.)
2) Storytelling of value (vs. providing tools and training) goes a long way: Using trained participants as your story-tellers, as your panelist, etc. will help build trust, which will be the secret glue and catalyst.
3) Responsible usage will ensure longevity: Lots of people do not realize the potential risks around usage/bias/hallucination/data quality/etc. Successful participants should not only be trained on AI, but trained on responsible use of AI.
4) This is a fantastic crowd-sourcing opportunity as well, beyond AI: You can literally use the training initiative, to collect what are the key challenges cohorts are facing (in their life, in their job), etc. to inform country-wide planning.
5) Foundational learning path as base, and then forks from there: Providing everyone a basic understanding and working knowledge, and then building on top for specific cohorts.",2025-09-04T17:33:04.179Z,1757007184179,0,0,0,0,ACoAAASHjGABaMJHeaJzEG5XuDXGWplrSeUMkyU,Ahmad Ovais,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmadovais,"National AI to ROI Leader, Partner BDO Canada | Transformation Leader | Father, Builder, Problem Solver",False,False,True,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tareq-amin_humainacademy-humainai-vision2030-activity-7369227868972691457-0KQD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACCpDGQBLE7ICN-CROeyxPPeLsCNhUqpCd0,1203,201,11,suggestion_idea,0.95,product_strategy_ops,0.9

The current focus in AI space has been increasingly on the tools, technology and enabling infrastructure where i think certain domains need equal attention AI trainings should be designed on a holistic scale to cover the the following domains with specialized programs to cover these disciplines & their integration with each other, i believe HUMAIN surely has all it takes to address this right:

1) AI Governance: a focus around AI and Governance knowledge and skills at boards and executive management level; with 56% increase in AI incidents globally compared to the last year according to AI index report 2025...

2) AI Management: ongoing management of AI in the organizations on the track of adoption also requires special skills and competence.

3) AI Tools & Technologies, already a focus area

4) Responsible AI - Covering Risk, Compliance, Ethical and privacy concerns

5) AI Cyber Security - Covering Cyber security aspects on AI 

6) AI Sec Ops - Covering technical security offensive vs defensive AI in Sec Ops space.

1. Building Real AI Agents: Rather than just teaching prompts or prototypes, we should guide learners in creating task-focused models that automate repetitive work across sectors like finance, healthcare, logistics, and more. Each learner should complete deployable solutions as part of their portfolio.

2. Guiding Real-World Deployment: Help participants move from the sandbox to production by connecting agents to APIs, real data, and enterprise workflows. This experience will be invaluable in teaching how to scale and integrate AI models into actual business environments.

3. Establishing a Central Governance Hub: Create a central registry for every agent, ensuring they are permissioned, auditable, and comply with ethical and legal standards. This will enable safe, scalable growth of the AI ecosystem and provide the foundation for ongoing interoperability and governance.

If we consider HUMAIN Academy as an AI academy, here is my reflection on the first question - developed with the help of generative AI tools:
Q1: What areas should the AI Academy focus on most?
 1️⃣ Arabic-first AI: Build strong tools for Arabic (MSA + dialects), speech, text, and right-to-left UX, with datasets that reflect our culture and needs.
 2️⃣ End-to-end AI operations: Teach how to take AI from raw data all the way to production systems (MLOps & LLMOps).
 3️⃣ Security & governance: Protect data, test for safety, and manage bias from the start.
 4️⃣ Productization: Focus on solving real business problems with measurable impact (ROI, KPIs).
 5️⃣ Edge & industry use cases: AI for energy, logistics, healthcare, and smart cities.
 6️⃣ Talent & entrepreneurship: Apprenticeships with real teams + a venture studio to turn ideas into startups.
👉 In short: The Academy should prepare learners not just to “know AI,” but to build, operate, and scale it responsibly in Saudi Arabia.",2025-09-04T13:57:06.313Z,1756994226313,0,0,0,0,ACoAACTsMUYBfGWWN8zFTF58pz-zOyjniG52668,Husni Al-Muhtaseb,https://www.linkedin.com/in/husni-al-muhtaseb-19a557153,"Assistant Professor | Arabic NLP, OCR & AI | 2 Patents • 50+ Publications | Research & Higher Ed Leader",False,False,False,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tareq-amin_humainacademy-humainai-vision2030-activity-7369227868972691457-0KQD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACCpDGQBLE7ICN-CROeyxPPeLsCNhUqpCd0,992,161,8,suggestion_idea,0.95,data_ai_ml,0.9

One thought: your audience feels very broad -  students, professionals, and entrepreneurs all learn differently with different learning objectives. For example, an entrepreneur might need support on prototyping an AI solution and turning it into a scalable business, while a student may need applied foundations and employability skills to land their first role. Segmenting these groups and understanding their needs early could make the Academy far more impactful.

To your questions:
- Focus areas: define clear learning journeys for each segment (students → foundations + employability; professionals → applied tools in their industry; entrepreneurs → prototyping + scaling).

- What’s missing today: most AI training is “one-size-fits-all.” What’s missing is tailoring content and methods to the learner’s context.

- Ideal learning path: segmented tracks — foundations first, then hands-on projects, ending with either functional applications (for example, students), industry applications (for professionals) or venture-building modules (for entrepreneurs).

It really made me think. How about practical use cases and tactics related to marketing, branding & comms, as opposed to focusing on the development side (or solely ethics or governance) like many academies/courses do? A module or course on how AI is reshaping branding, consumer psychology, marketing, or communication by analysing cross-industry case studies. Take my agency decipher., (we focus on copywriting meets AI search optimisation), and our own most recent example speaks volumes: we managed to appear in ChatGPT and Perplexity in the UAE after 4 - 5 months of optimising and adapting our content strategy. 

My point is that AI isn’t just reshaping marketing workflows; it’s reshaping the consumer’s behaviour, how they search, shop, and decide.

I’d bet on AI model usage and specialization.

•Cross-functional collaboration skills - AI professionals need to work effectively with business stakeholders, not just other technical people
•Rapid prototyping and iteration - Teaching students to build quick proofs of concept before investing in full solutions

This isn’t about reinventing the wheel; it’s about enabling people to design better wheels — new models, novel techniques, and transformative applications that go beyond current limitations.

The academy should provide a powerful, on-demand AI lab, leveraging Humain’s cloud infra. Students should have seamless access to compute resources and real-time data streams (e.g., GA Stats, Google Maps, public health APIs). This infrastructure enables hands-on learning that’s grounded in real-world complexity.

I see this closely in robotics. Computer vision engineers want to test their models on something dynamic and unpredictable. They build a basic robot and test it. They inadvertently learn mechanical design, power systems, embedded systems, etc.

AI needs to learn on physical systems, and the best physical system that encompasses all of this is robotics.

I personally integrate LLMs with swarms of robots, to realize how LLMs may seem logical but they constantly fail in grasping fundamental knowledge. I call this the ""Aha"" moment—when an AI model observes its real behavior in the real world.

So, ask them to develop AI on constrained systems, and they will with time start to get the real-world application of AI.",2025-09-04T11:00:40.540Z,1756983640540,0,0,0,0,ACoAACj0fjUBE2T4mLxhy_fTsFBUMo9NxjegSg4,Ziyad Alanazi,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ziyad-alanazi-131142172,Autonomous engineer | Robotics engineer | ROS2 | SLAM | Computer Vision | AI in robotics | KFUPM Master Graduate,False,False,False,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tareq-amin_humainacademy-humainai-vision2030-activity-7369227868972691457-0KQD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACCpDGQBLE7ICN-CROeyxPPeLsCNhUqpCd0,848,145,9,suggestion_idea,0.9,data_ai_ml,0.9

In contrast Al Azhar University's affiliates had a common-ish curriculum across more physical space than the Jesuits (apples and oranges in some ways but ""people of the book"" were fairly rare at the time).

It a people problem to solve first, not a technology problem. You have to start with who is your audience. Mine is predominantly white collar office based professionals. The technology is there to transform the learning experience but society is not ready yet. 

What I have found is that people need it to be contextualized into examples and workflows that they do everyday. When we talk about AI improving efficiency the vast majority of the workforce get exposed to AI through tools or applications. They don't need to know in depth how AI works under the covers or how to build AI solutions to be able to use AI tools.  

Take your app Humain Chat for example, if i was to do a day session to empower a HR team to get utilization from your app it would be 90% exercises, examples, scenarios from their day to day work and 10% on AI to help give them a bit more context.

As kids grow up in an AI-first world, the differentiator won’t be tool knowledge but the ability to stay creative, think critically, and solve real problems while amplifying those strengths with AI.

From experience, I’ve seen how powerful it is when learning moves beyond content delivery into hands-on, scalable programs that prepare people for both today’s jobs and tomorrow’s challenges.

That means designing programs that:
	•	Pair technical fluency with human creativity.
	•	Embed experimentation, reflection, and adaptability into the learning process.
	•	Build skills that are both future-proof and directly relevant to workplaces.

If HUMAIN Academy gets this right, it won’t be delivering training in isolation; it will also  shape a generation ready to imagine, lead, and drive meaningful impact in the age of AI.

What would set HUMAIN Academy apart is making impact the curriculum and goal

Imagine each track designed as a problem → pilot → production journey:

Learners start with real sector briefs (health, logistics, energy, Arabic NLP).
They ship a thin-slice prototype, then iterate with mentors and user feedback.
Mentors aren’t just advisors they’re industry partners. guidance tied to real outcomes, and they act as the bridge to employers.

Every step measured; not just deployment success, but which skills (technical, business, and soft) were applied, owned, and developed along the way.
This creates a skills-first model that’s evidence-driven, not tied to academic grades, and provides a reusable template for future cohorts.

“Graduates” don’t just walk away with certificates - they leave with a portfolio of deployed solutions and direct pathways into AI roles within the very companies providing mentorship.

That way HUMAIN Academy becomes more than training, it’s a capacity-building engine, talent pipeline, and skills benchmark for Saudi’s AI ecosystem.",2025-09-04T10:13:36.254Z,1756980816254,0,0,0,0,ACoAAAAWST0Bxz1Jn18LeIrBjb1__WG4OQW2u2o,Waheed Malik,https://www.linkedin.com/in/waheedmalik,"Founder, Engage+ | Building Skills Intelligence Platforms for Goal-Driven Growth | 20+ Yrs in Global Talent Development & Recruitment",False,False,False,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tareq-amin_humainacademy-humainai-vision2030-activity-7369227868972691457-0KQD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACCpDGQBLE7ICN-CROeyxPPeLsCNhUqpCd0,1137,178,9,suggestion_idea,0.95,leadership_exec,0.9

The magic happens when you blend disciplines from day one. Think psychologists helping engineers understand user resistance, philosophers guiding ethical decisions, and artists pushing creative boundaries alongside computer scientists. Real innovation lives at these intersections.

From Riyadh's unique position, you can bridge global perspectives on AI - how different cultures interact with technology, what Saudi innovation brings to the world stage.

We don't need more isolated AI builders. We need practitioners who understand that AI succeeds or fails based on how well it fits into real human systems. That's education that actually moves the needle.

	•	Embedding training in real Saudi use cases (logistics, retail, healthcare, government).
	•	A structured learning path that moves from awareness → hands-on practice → organizational adoption, rather than just short workshops or certificates.

In my view, competency in AI (or any field) consists of three key elements:
● Knowledge: Understanding the fundamental concepts and theories, usually gained through academic study, books, and research.
● Skills: The ability to apply knowledge in practice, such as implementing algorithms or training/fine-tuning models.
● Experience: Developed over time through hands-on work, successes, and failures, in the context of the Academy, maybe through 6–9 months of on-the-job training in HUMAIN or with partners.

The curriculum for any AI program should align with the target role and balance knowledge and skills accordingly. Typical career paths include:
● AI Researcher
● AI Engineer
● Data Engineer
● Data Scientist
● AI Developer

Instead of just certificates, every graduate should leave with a portfolio of deployable projects, direct exposure to industry partners, and a clear pathway into jobs. Pair that with an AI-first learning platform (personalized paths, AI mentor feedback, gamified progress) and HUMAIN can become the region’s go-to hub for producing not just AI users, but AI builders aligned with Vision 2030. 

To make it truly stand out, it can become the place where students, professionals, and leaders all find value:
Students & graduates → hands-on AI skills and projects that make them job-ready.
Working professionals → upskilling on GenAI, LLMs, and practical AI deployment.
Executives & policymakers → learning how to adopt AI responsibly and at scale.

To build this right, HUMAIN should:
 1. Launch a pilot cohort in Riyadh tied to Vision 2030 sectors.
 2. Partner with corporates for real projects and data.
 3. Create an AI-first learning platform that personalizes learning, provides AI mentor feedback, and gamifies progress.",2025-09-04T09:06:34.819Z,1756976794819,0,0,0,0,ACoAACJDyfkB5MPmIuEKkUot2ZyeS5AnaRC6YgU,Usama Javed,https://www.linkedin.com/in/usamajaved307,"Senior UX Consultant | Research, Design Thinking & Scalable Digital Experiences",False,False,True,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tareq-amin_humainacademy-humainai-vision2030-activity-7369227868972691457-0KQD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACCpDGQBLE7ICN-CROeyxPPeLsCNhUqpCd0,1242,195,12,suggestion_idea,0.95,entrepreneur_advisor,0.9

Since then, I have dedicated my life to training the next generation in data management and data governance, and I am now pursuing my PhD in Artificial Intelligence not just as an academic path, but as a mission to fulfill a father’s dream.

My greatest hope is that throughِ Allah and then AI, I can one day hear my daughter speak those words to me.

 My point is this: if AI efforts like #HUMAIN_Academy focus on solving real human problems and addressing challenges across different sectors, the impact will go far beyond certifications — it will truly change people’s lives.",2025-09-04T08:52:05.399Z,1756975925399,0,3,0,0,ACoAACl9JKoB8kLHFzIqYKjpsVO1HEfV95ui5VA,AHMED ALORAGE.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-alorage-836140175,"DPBOK Digital Transformation, TOGAF Enterprise Architecture & DAMA CDMP Data Management Senior Leader | 15+ Years Cross-Industry Experience | Technology Leadership Instructor | PhD student",False,False,True,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tareq-amin_humainacademy-humainai-vision2030-activity-7369227868972691457-0KQD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACCpDGQBLE7ICN-CROeyxPPeLsCNhUqpCd0,917,169,6,suggestion_idea,0.9,product_strategy_ops,0.9

For this I would suggest a layered educational approach in which the knowledge and skills sets will be built layer by layer; upon a strong foundation and layered up to very specific industry use case.
For example it can be:
Foundational training
Core skills training including the cybersecurity threats associated with the use of such technology 
And finally industry specific use case training

One area where HUMAIN Academy could truly stand out is by aligning AI training with real business impact. Beyond technical knowledge, companies need programs that:

Upskill employees by department (operations, finance, HR, sales, investment, etc.) with tailored learning paths connected to their daily workflows.

Define clear KPIs so training outcomes translate into measurable business results, not just certificates.

Equip business leaders (COOs, managers, team heads) to identify and pilot real AI use cases that drive growth, efficiency, and client value.

Combine practical immersion (applying AI on real company challenges) with soft skills development, so teams learn how to collaborate with AI as a true colleague — building trust, judgment, and augmented decision-making.

This way, training doesn’t just close the skills gap — it transforms the way organizations work, lead, and compete.

In my opinion, the three most important pillars upon which the academy should be built are:
1️⃣ Learning by doing (real-life applied projects).
2️⃣ Connecting with companies to test solutions directly.
3️⃣ Business + technology skills combined (Business + AI).

This combination is what creates a generation capable of not only learning, but also actually building solutions that serve Vision 2030. 🚀

Two aspects I’d emphasize:
 -> Methodology – teaching people how to learn AI, while also letting AI itself adapt to the learner’s pace, language, and style. This personalized learning journey will be the real unlock, though tuning it to the last mile will be challenging.
 -> Domain context – applied AI isn’t one-size-fits-all. We’re laser-focused on connectivity and adjacent domains (mobile, #quantum, #privateAI, #swarmintelligence for distributed #physicalAI).
Personally, I see physical AI (#robots, #distributeddevices, #embodiedsystems) as a low-hanging fruit to move AI out of the PC and into daily imagination and interaction. Even at home, I explore this with my kids (11, 8, and 6), it sparks curiosity and makes AI tangible.

Would love to explore collaboration. HUMAIN Academy × 6G Academy could really accelerate the Vision 2030 goals for practical AI talent.

1) For students, out-dated curriculum, pricey tools lack of industry exposure (that's why there's a decline in recent graduates hirings ) 

2) For mid- senior level professionals : The industry is moving too quickly that apart from the people from tech or a few enthusiasts its hard to keep up with AI, it becomes even harder when English is not your primary language, even hardest when its not even your secondary language. 

3) Most of the AI training available online is tool mastery, they're not centered around workflows, process optimization and hence dont seem to deliver ""outcomes"" 

4) For entrepreneurs, although they can overcome all the above three and come up with a great product, their L&D needs lie around AI Bias, Safety and Governance.

1. Foundational Strategy & Collaboration
 - Establish a Tripartite Alliance: Success depends on a deep, sustainable partnership between Industry, Government, and Academia. This ensures long-term vision and shared goals.
 - Adopt a ""Shift Left"" Philosophy: Focus on strengthening the fundamentals first. Build a strong base of knowledge and talent before rushing to high-level applications. This creates innovators, not just users.
2. Talent Development & Education Pipeline
 - Strengthen Core Curriculum: Review and enhance the curriculum from school to university, focusing on core subjects like Mathematics, Logic, Core Science and fundamental Computer Science.
 - Prevent Cognitive Dependency: Design learning paths, especially for young students, that prioritize critical thinking and problem-solving skills over premature reliance on AI tools. This avoids creating a generation that can't innovate independently. Super Critical.

What areas do you believe we should focus on most?

- Strategic AI Implementation: theory to deployment and scaling in KSA
- AI Leadership: Change management, tech communication, AI-ready culture
- Generative AI: hands-on experience, prompt engineering, business applications
- Human-AI Collaboration: intelligent workflows that amplify capabilities
- Risk & Compliance: cybersecurity, regulatory frameworks, ethical AI

What's missing from AI training today that HUMAIN Academy can solve?

The regional context gap. Current programs miss:

- Data Sovereignty: Saudi regulations and cultural sensitivities
- Infrastructure: Practical compute solutions in region
- Vision 2030: AI for energy, tourism, manufacturing, finance
- Arabic AI: NLP and culturally relevant applications

If you had to design your ideal AI learning path, what would it look like?

Hybrid program: Riyadh intensives with online sessions. Building a network of Saudi AI practitioners would be the key highlight.

But what’s still missing—and where HUMAIN can really stand out—is creating specialized AI courses for professionals in different industries. For example, AI for Accountants, AI for Business Developers, AI for Healthcare Professionals. These courses wouldn’t dive too deep into technical or theoretical details, but instead focus on showing professionals how AI can directly improve their work and boost productivity.


This kind of practical approach can have a big impact on both careers and industries as a whole.

Areas to focus: relevant examples are key. For instance when training financial analysts focus on retrieving data from financial filings for deeper analysis, when its lawyers then focus on laws and regulations. Main issue with tutorials is giving abstract examples like booking an airline ticket. 

2. What’s missing is a lack of “video gamer” mindset. This means a tutorial must first deliver that aha moment immediately by getting users to run a program fast so they can play with it. And only then start breaking down the concepts needed to build it. I ran a course like this recently. Link below. 

3. Ideal learning path for knowledge workers should start from the most fun things which in my mind is just getting a GitHub repo to run. Trouble shooting is vastly more relevant for new users than core programming. Once they know how to immediately apply what they’ve learned, then the fly wheel begins.

I ran a course like this in Karachi recently. Wish you the best with Humain!

One sector that should not be overlooked by Humain Academy is universities. As the largest “pre-job-market prep programs,” they play a key role in shaping future talent. However, university program curricula are often disconnected from labor market needs, and adapting to rapid digital change is slow., as many faculty still see AI as a threat rather than an enabling tool.
To drive meaningful change, AI training for universities must redefine their role in preparing graduates for today’s and tomorrow’s job market. Two guiding values are key: First, alignment, using curriculum mapping to link courses to any pre-defined national qualification frameworks and employer-demanded skills. Second: integration, embedding AI across all courses across programs, not just electives.
This approach produces more competitive programs and curricula that remain relevant. For faculty, buy-in comes from practical, immediate value. AI should be framed as a practical, empowering tool that saves time and boosts productivity in tasks like: course design, grading, research support, content creation, etc.

Instead of a “learn-then-try” approach, adopting a “try-then-learn” model could be powerful.

Coupled with real-world case studies and partnerships with global companies, this would create a hands-on learning experience that surpasses traditional university-level education.

The focus on practical skills is exactly what's needed in the region.

My thoughts on your questions:
Focus Areas: Consider specialized tracks for key Vision 2030 sectors (Energy, Smart Cities) and practical workshops on Applied Generative AI for business.
What's Missing: The biggest gap in AI training today is often the ""last mile"" of deployment (MLOps) and dedicated strategy training for non-technical leaders.
Ideal Path: A project-based model with three tiers would be powerful: 1) The Practitioner (build a real project), 2) The Architect (deploy it at scale), and 3) The Strategist (a track for managers).

Focus Areas
I think the priority should be on applied generative AI, actually fine-tuning models and building things like RAG systems, not just theory. MLOps is another big one, since deploying, monitoring, and scaling AI in real environments is where most people struggle. And finally, it would be valuable to design domain-specific tracks for key Saudi industries like energy, logistics, and finance.

2. What’s missing
Most programs stop short of teaching the “last mile”; how to get models into production. There’s also a lack of training with real-world, messy datasets, since most examples are too clean and academic. And I’d love to see more focus on business translation, helping people connect AI projects directly to business goals and RoI.

3. Ideal Learning Path
In my view, the best path would start with a short foundation, then move into specialized tracks (like engineer or architect), and end with a capstone project done with an industry partner with a market deployment and GTM in mind. That way, learners graduate with something real they’ve built and deployed.",2025-09-04T07:51:24.166Z,1756972284166,0,0,0,0,ACoAAAZzRTEBTkEjfjDe9auSW_zhpDmtNLPIKd0,Abdulaziz AlBatli,https://www.linkedin.com/in/itsalbatli,General Manager | Cloud Aficionado | Market Developer | Policy & Regulation,False,False,False,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tareq-amin_humainacademy-humainai-vision2030-activity-7369227868972691457-0KQD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACCpDGQBLE7ICN-CROeyxPPeLsCNhUqpCd0,1084,182,11,suggestion_idea,0.95,entrepreneur_advisor,0.2

Let's start with what (probably) is not needed:
- super technical deep dive into how LLMs work and how to build one
- MBA type of blah blah about digital transformation and how corps need to adopt AI

On the other, this is what I feel the market needs:
1) Businesses (and primarily the SMEs /startups that are growing so quickly in Saudi) to know how to adopt AI in the most practical way in various functions, appropriate to their size. I.e.not how banks implement their custom built LLMs but how the local restaurant chain or travel agency can benefit from it

2) It's what's skills are lacking in the market. For both Saudi companies but also international companies coming to the market (to make sure they first use local talent before bringing people from abroad). This will perhaps have different levels. First - basic literacy; as everyone learned to use internet, there's benefit if everyone learns to use Humain or chatgpt for basic daily tasks. Then more role specific to teach how to use Ai for different roles at daily work.

There's probably more but it's already a very lonng comment 😊",2025-09-04T07:43:14.743Z,1756971794743,0,0,0,0,ACoAAAem42sB2hw0vexaiVFjYGhSHq3MyPJUhk0,Lukas Krejca,https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukaskrejca,"Growth, Automation, AI | Exciting Experiences @ Ithara.ae",False,False,False,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tareq-amin_humainacademy-humainai-vision2030-activity-7369227868972691457-0KQD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACCpDGQBLE7ICN-CROeyxPPeLsCNhUqpCd0,1159,209,10,suggestion_idea,0.95,entrepreneur_advisor,0.2

I believe a successful AI academy should include the following elements:
– A social platform that democratizes AI education and connects universities, companies, and lifelong learners.
– A course marketplace where anyone can be both a teacher and a learner. This is the core idea of ​​our CourseMapper platform (https://coursemapper.de), where anyone can offer or register for courses.
– The opportunity to collaborate across institutions on interdisciplinary real-world projects.

Have a look at Ecole 42 founded by Xavier Niel, Free's telco founder. I like their program and method (pragmatic and peer to peer). It is inclusive and has had great results so far. 

From my own experience teaching Digital Transformation to business school students here in France, or training teams and clients, I would say it is important to build 
1) well rounded talents beyond AI eg a well thought core course (incl. cybersec, AI ethics etc). Ethics and gouvernance should be a key component
2) be very practical and team/ network oriented  (peer to peer and team cases, internships). The best AI projects i have worked on where those with a bunch of specialists working well together.

I really admire the fact that HUMAIN Academy is the committed to move past theory and certifications - exactly what the market in Saudi (and globally) is missing today.

In my view, the biggest gaps in current AI training are:
1️⃣ Lack of practical exposure to real tools, datasets, and deployment scenarios.
2️⃣ Minimal focus on industry use cases - most programs don’t show how AI transforms sectors like fintech, telecom, healthcare, or energy.
3️⃣ The missing layer of entrepreneurship and product-building - how to take an AI idea from prototype to scale.

An ideal AI learning path would start with core foundations, but quickly shift into project-based learning, hackathons, and industry-led challenges. Learners should graduate not just with knowledge, but with a portfolio of AI projects they can showcase to employers or investors.

I believe HUMAIN Academy has the potential to become the go-to hub for practical AI talent in Saudi and beyond.

I recommend integrating this move into a comprehensive regulatory framework that embeds AI into Education, Training, Practice, Research, Development, and Innovation, across all sectors. Such an approach will not only maximize HUMAIN Academy return on investment but also amplify its overall impact.

To this matter, I have drafted a regulatory framework proposal on integrating AI into Health Professions Education, Training, Practice and Research. This proposal has been accepted for presentation at the International Hospital Federation Congress Meeting in Geneva this coming November 10–13.

The framework is scalable and adaptable across all sectors. Strategically embedding it into the Academy will accelerate the impact you aim to achieve, while also aligning all regulatory authorities with this forward-looking direction, one that shapes not only the future, but the present as well.

Envisioning HUMAIN Academy advancing this transformation across all sectors.

Areas to focus on most
Building strong foundations in data engineering, MLOps, and automation—with hands-on labs in ERP and Procure-to-Pay workflows. Adding process mining and robotics will give participants the tools to streamline real business operations, not just build models.

2. What’s missing in current AI training
Many programs focus mainly on theory or small demos. What’s often missing is real integration—how AI connects to enterprise systems, handles compliance, scales on cloud infrastructure, and stays auditable. HUMAIN can bridge that gap by training participants to deploy AI in production environments.

3. The ideal AI learning path
Start with core data & cloud skills, then move into specialized tracks (AI engineering, intelligent automation, applied AI for finance, healthcare, logistics). Cap it off with capstone projects on HUMAIN infrastructure, so participants leave with practical experience running AI at scale.

👉 What areas do you believe we should focus on most?
1. Critical Thinking (currently, we are becoming so dependent on AI that we no longer think, let alone critically think)
2. Effective Communication (using different communication analysis tools)

👉 What’s missing from AI training today that HUMAIN Academy can solve?
1. Training accessibility (right now, every training is becoming expensive for no reason, and it limits reach)
2. Lack of practicality (most training sessions focuses on theory and best case scenario, I want more rainy day scenarios)

👉 If you had to design your ideal AI learning path, what would it look like?
My ideal path would be as follows
1. Practical first hand experience (learning through trial and error)
2. Original theory and how it developed over time (growth and development)
3. Different systematic approaches to real life scenarios (critical thinking)
4. Decision-making evaluation (strategic thinking)

 Most training today treats AI as an end in itself. The academy should frame AI as an enabler—something to be applied to real business, social, and entrepreneurial challenges. This mindset shift will make your graduates stand out.
2️) Hands-On, Project-Based Learning
 Instead of just teaching how models work, let participants build, deploy, and scale solutions with real datasets, real platforms  and real constraints (cost, compliance, ethics). Employers value this readiness.
3️) Bridging Ecosystems
 Create tracks not only for students and professionals, but also for SMEs, startups, and government entities.

Focusing on practical, hands-on training is truly needed to build a future-ready workforce for Saudi Arabia.

From my experience, the most impactful initiatives go beyond just training individuals and instead build a full AI-native ecosystem. To move the needle, HUMAIN Academy could start with a high-impact tactical plan that feeds into a national strategy. My thoughts are on two key areas:

1.      Launch a 'Problem-to-Product' Sprint. Instead of traditional courses, these short, intense sprints would focus on solving real-world, national challenges (e.g., optimizing logistics for a Saudi port). This builds tangible portfolios for participants and generates immediate results.

2.      Develop a Tiered National Talent Framework. The strategic move is to create a three-tiered system: AI Literacy for the general workforce, 'AI Translators' to bridge business needs, and World-Class Researchers to innovate.

This framework would not only equip individuals but also position Saudi Arabia as a leader in applying AI to solve its most critical challenges.

- Building foundation in all AI paradigms is really necessary to be aware of various paradigms.

- Blinding the training with effective bootcamp (tackling outstanding public issues).

Bridging theory and practice – ensuring students grasp AI fundamentals in ways that can be directly applied in the workplace.
Entrepreneurship and innovation – empowering learners to develop scalable, executable AI solutions and products.
Advanced skill development – including machine learning, deep learning, data analytics, and natural language processing, with a strong focus on practical applicability.

2. What’s missing in current AI training: Too much theory, too many slides. What’s missing is the full journey — idea → model → deployment → scale.

3. The ideal learning path:
	•	Clear, simple fundamentals.
	•	Hands-on projects with real data.
	•	Live deployment + expert feedback.
	•	Support for scaling and monetization.

The second is the disconnect between tech, industry, govt and reg and the people. AI needs a collaborative approach to upskill, train, inform and discuss.

What works well from your message is getting hands on, at every level getting hands on and using the tools teaches more than any lecture. We have to bring knowledge and education to the learners not the other way around, and making it exciting and interactive is the start.

Congratulations on shaping a vision that truly rethinks how AI training should be delivered in Saudi and the wider region.

From our experience, this is what resonates most:
1. Build tracks for priority sectors in Saudi Vision 2030 (energy, finance, healthcare, logistics, construction)
2. Bridging leadership & strategy with AI adoption — AI + Leadership & Change Management
- Most AI programs focus on tools; very few prepare leaders to drive adoption, manage AI ethics, and align AI with business strategy.
3.    Entrepreneurship & AI for Startups
- Offer a track that empowers entrepreneurs to build AI-powered businesses, pitch investors, and deploy MVPs.
- This fills a gap as most AI training ignores the startup ecosystem in Saudi.

Most importantly, what’s missing today is training rarely addresses AI implementation barriers: change management, culture, and workforce adoption. Building on the leadership and behavioral change it’s a win.

Even for folks who work in AI daily, have struggled to keep up so you can only imagine how folks who are not interacting with AI. 

- Some mechanism to encourage daily use. Gamification helps but it really happens when people are incentivised and appraised.

- Learning should not be limited to theory, people need to be given means to practice. A dedicated small learning budget (e.g. everyone gets SAR2000 per year) 

- An internal ""incubator"" that oversees some of these practical ideas and scales it deep and wide. This is where I saw IMPACT when I was running AI projects for marketing worth $1.6B at Google

Or would it be more impactful to create a real experience for children—where they learn programming, discover for themselves whether this is a path worth pursuing, feel their passion, or realize there may be another direction for them?
in Jordan, a business incubator launched an initiative called (JeelCode), targeting children aged 9 to 14. The focus was on developing future leaders, with the vision that it would take only ten years to achieve meaningful results.

	•	Inclusive by design: programs should meet the needs of all employees, from entry-level to top management.
	•	Flexible in depth and duration: ranging from short orientations to multi-month deep learning tracks.
	•	Holistic in scope: covering AI development and enhancement, usability and application, as well as risk, control, and governance.
	•	Sector-specific: tailored programs for industries such as healthcare, smart cities, cybersecurity, and law — enabling professionals to apply AI in their fields and feed back insights into better use cases.

Training done right becomes more than a skill-building exercise — it becomes a driver of responsible AI adoption and sustainable growth.

>8-week path: Foundations & safety → Build & evaluate → Integrate & optimize → Operate & govern → Sector capstone (Saudi use case).

If I imagine the ideal learning path, I see 3 layers:

1. Hands-on AI labs – Where people actually play with the tools, not just theory.
2. Adaptability sprints – Short cycles to build resilience and problem-solving under change.
3. Future track – Advanced exploration like quantum computing or digital twins for early adopters.

That way it’s not just about certificates like you mentioned but about building real skills for real projects in KSA and the region.

The focus on practical, hands-on AI training is exactly what’s missing in most programs today.

I see a huge opportunity for HUMAIN Academy to design domain-focused AI tracks that go beyond generic training. For eg:
	•	Applied AI for critical industries (telecom, infrastructure, healthcare, logistics, energy) so learners see real use cases with impact.
	•	Data-to-deployment skills: cleaning, integrating, and operationalizing AI at scale, not just building models.
	•	AI for business strategy & transformation: helping leaders align AI with organizational vision.
	•	Responsible & secure AI essential for regulated sectors like telecom.

An ideal learning path could look like:
	1.	Foundations: AI/ML basics and prompt engineering.
	2.	Hands-on labs: projects on real AI tools and platforms.
	3.	Industry/domain-specific modules e.g., AI in telecom networks, smart cities, customer experience.
	4.	Capstone project: solving real-world challenges with industry mentorship.

It's about building a Learning Strategy that supports the next stage of the AI journey.

-  LOOK AHEAD & ASSESS:  The need is shifting from basic AI literacy to ethical, domain-specific business process knowledge application. We must train for human-in-the-loop collaboration and specialised skills.
- BUILD NEEDED SKILLS:  Focus on a hyper-specialised curriculum, innovative delivery with AI-powered platforms, and establishing thought leadership. 

The current trend is toward full-scale orchestration platforms. These platforms represent the commoditised knowledge of today's consulting firms and use clickable agents to automate responses to customer requirements. 

Hence, we need to re-skill our people into business process experts, letting the AI do the heavy technical lifting. 

This requires a two-part approach: 
1) developing strong technical experts who can handle the LLMs and their capabilities, and 
2) Cultivating strong strategic leaders who can pioneer new business models.

The vision for Humain Academy feels very timely and much needed in the region.

From my own experience working on AI use cases in healthcare and telecom, one of the biggest gaps I’ve noticed is the bridge between theoretical knowledge and practical, enterprise-ready implementation. Learners often understand concepts but struggle to apply them in real-world, industry-grade scenarios.

I’d suggest focusing on:
Hands-on labs where learners can build and deploy AI models on real datasets.
End-to-end projects (from data preparation to deployment & monitoring) to simulate the true lifecycle of AI solutions.
Domain-focused tracks (healthcare, finance, telecom, government) so participants see immediate relevance to their industries.
Agentic AI and LLMOps as these are the future of scalable, enterprise adoption.

If Humain Academy can deliver training that produces not just AI enthusiasts, but AI practitioners ready to contribute from day one, it will be a remarkable achievement for Saudi and the region.

Hunain Academy can address a critical gap—developing talent that is not only certified, but capable of delivering measurable impact.

Academc training must be progressive, balanced, and multidimensional—integrating skills, knowledge, and experience as complementary pillars. Motivation to learn is a spark; without structure, it fades. The Academy can turn that spark into a sustainable flame by meeting learners at different entry points and guiding them through well-designed stages.

Global best practices, the NICE Framework, emphasize aligning skill, knowledge, and competency with industry outcomes. In this context, Hunain Academy should put learner motivation at the center—a higher priority than filtering or testing. Challenges should serve as enablers, introduced purposefully to reinforce learning or validate readiness, never at the cost of discouragement. Sustaining motivation first ensures lasting engagement, stronger performance, and real employability.

Ultimately, the true benchmark is not certification, but the ability to apply skills with efficiency, confidence, and impact. Hunain Academy has the opportunity to set that benchmark—not only for Saudi Arabia, but for the wider region.",2025-09-04T05:21:39.566Z,1756963299566,0,0,0,0,ACoAAAlqsKEBl7Z3czo2SXC5I9HHnqPoPtLAtwE,Nawwaf Alabdulhadi,https://www.linkedin.com/in/nawwafalabdulhadi,Cybersecurity Strategist | National Ecosystem & Digital Architecture Leader | Regulatory Frameworks & Digital Transformation | Program Orchestration | Harvard | CMU | U.S. Patent Holder,False,False,False,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tareq-amin_humainacademy-humainai-vision2030-activity-7369227868972691457-0KQD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACCpDGQBLE7ICN-CROeyxPPeLsCNhUqpCd0,1246,177,11,suggestion_idea,0.95,product_strategy_ops,0.9

Just completed Stanford’s Post Grad Certificate in AI and ML - the theory is world-class but what’s missing is the 0-to-1 journey. How to choose between GPT-5, Claude, Gemini or now HUMAIN for YOUR specific use case. How to handle edge cases when your users aren’t typical (at Futuroos, we’re building AI-powered behavioral assessment for 5-9 year olds that predicts career aptitudes through gameplay and learn from it as well - try explaining that to traditional ML approaches). How to optimize costs without sacrificing quality when you need real-time inference.

My ideal AI learning path: Start with a real problem, ship something in week 1, iterate with actual user feedback, THEN understand why it works. Theory should support building, not precede it.

Would love to see Hunain Academy focus on ‘AI in production’ - dealing with rate limits, handling hallucinations, building guardrails for sensitive use cases (essential when your AI assesses children’s potential). The messy stuff that actually determines if your product succeeds.

 - Professionals: how to apply AI in their daily work.
  - Entrepreneurs: building scalable AI products.

2- Hands-on labs: real projects on Hugging Face, NVIDIA, TensorFlow—no more “slide-only” training.

3- Strategic partnerships: with Saudi universities (KSU, KAUST, KFUPM) and companies like STC, Huawei, Microsoft, NVIDIA.

4- Micro-credentials: short 2–6 week programs in Generative AI, MLOps, AI ethics, and autonomous systems. 

5- Connecting tech with business: add modules on marketing, entrepreneurship, and data governance so graduates can turn code into products.

6- Real saudi case studies: healthcare, energy, transport, and finance projects tied to Vision 2030.

7- AI community hub: Q&A platform, code sharing, plus hackathons and competitions to keep learners engaged.

What excites me most is how Hunain Academy can become the real bridge between cutting-edge AI development at Humain and the practical skills the market urgently needs.

In my view, the most impactful areas to focus on would be:

Training talent to work directly with real AI models and platforms.

Building capabilities to deploy AI into industries like real estate, finance, and lifestyle where the need for innovation is accelerating.

Empowering professionals to connect creativity with technical execution, so they can design solutions that fuel both Humain’s growth and Saudi’s Vision 2030 goals.

To make Hunain Academy uniquely practical from day one, I’d prioritize three pillars:
Arabic-first LLM/RAG with PDPL/NDMO by design — evaluation harness (quality, latency, safety), red-teaming, and governance baked in.
Production-grade LLMOps — vLLM/Triton serving, CI/CD for models & prompts, observability (metrics/traces/logs), and clear SLOs.
AI FinOps — cost-per-token visibility, GPU utilization targets, caching/quantization playbooks to scale efficiently.
